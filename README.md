Party Planner
============

A tool for managing guest and seating arrangments.  Please see the wiki as I am making this code work with multiple parties that you
can create over time so you can having a living list of guest and a bank of guest that don't need to be at every party.  Its going to take a little while as many fields need to be moved.
